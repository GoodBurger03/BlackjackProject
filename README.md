## Lessons Learned

#### Using the UML works!
#### Planning or writing out the "Story" prior to starting the code is really beneficial.
#### This project was really challenging to me. It has so many different classes. OOP is something that i know is going to be so beneficial in my career but it is very challenging at this stage. I am happy with the end result although i owe a lot of credit to google searches and re reading modules. Going forward I think this will be a good program to refer back to. All in all, i am happy and I was challenged for sure.
